# Personal Website

**This is currently under construction and have not yet deployed it to my website**

I took up this website as a side-project once my daughter was about 1 year old, 
I finally felt like I had the time and energy to fully dedicate myself to a new project.
Previously the majority of my enerygy was taken up by work and kids!

My goal for this website is to showcase my React skills by building a design-library from scratch and also as
a medium to play around in and have fun with new technologies. My plan for this website is the following:
1. Create a design-library (from scratch)
1. Create themeing for the design library
    1. Eventually I want to have the ability for visitors to my website to create 
1. Create a blog (using graphql)
    1. This will have an "admin side" that makes use of some form components from the desing-library 
    1. It will have a markdown input that will render markdown to my design library components
1. Have this as the "hub" where I can show off my other side-projects that I have planned!
